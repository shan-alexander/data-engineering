# Newton's GCP Tutorials

This repo contains a collection of tutorials, code snippets, and screenshots to help you bootstrap a new GCP project, become familiar with Dataform, and exercise the skills used in GCP data engineering.

This repo was originally created to provide Dataform training materials for newly onboarded engineers (at a company I worked for previously, Google).
